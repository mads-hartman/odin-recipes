foundations html recipe assignment

For this project I have created a simple recipe page with links to recipes. it is written in html and styled with css. 

I have structured the webpage, created and linked the pages with relative links, added headings, images, and content. I used multiple headings and paragraphs, and oredered and unordered lists to arrange my content.
